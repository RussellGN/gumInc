# Gum.iNc website template

This is the template for a website, Gum.iNc.

## Status...24 july 2022

The template is currently not mobile responsive and **should only be viewed on desktop**.
Although mobile responsiveness is the whole point of bootstrap, I decided to focus
on getting the template structure sorted before making it responsive..this also
goes for the styling, although there are hints of it here and there...anyways
I'm still to properly work on the template's styling.

## Technologies used

**HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6) and Bootstrap 5 only**

## Dependancies

**None**

## Note...

Heavy usage of bootstrap classes in the HTML markup was made in order for quick prototyping
and to avoid going back and forth between html and css files

## To be done

1. make the about page more lively
2. make the template mobile responsive
3. work on the styling
